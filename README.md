This Quiz App was the final project for my Level 4 Software Development Apprenticeship. 

## Logging In
The website will redirect you to the log in page if you are not laready logged in. There are 3 types of user role; basic user, admin, super admin

There are log in details username (U) and password (P) on the log in page should you want play some of the quizzes. The details for the super admin are not available as that role gives access to create new quizzes and delete quizzes.

### Basic User
A basic user can; play all the quizzes, see your score, see stats about each quiz (number of plays, number of questions)

### Admin
An admin has all the permissions and features as a basic user but can also view the quiz questions and answers (correct and incorrect). These also shows how many people answered each question correctly.
